 Implementation of an OFDM based Transmission System using NI USRP

**Summary**
- successfully implemented a communication system using NI USRP 2922 (an SDR) in LabVIEW 2015 that works on the principle of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission
- involved execution of both efficient synchronization and dynamic channel estimation
- used LabVIEW, MATLAB
- part of the course 'PC 403 - B-Tech Mini Project' at DA-IICT, India
